# PowerSync SDK for React Native

*[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a Postgres-SQLite sync layer, which helps developers to create local-first real-time reactive apps that work seamlessly both online and offline.*

This package (`packages/react-native`) is the PowerSync SDK for React Native clients. It is an extension of `packages/common`.

See a summary of features [here](https://docs.powersync.co/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo).

# Installation

## Install Package

```bash
npx expo install @powersync/react-native
```

## Install Peer Dependency: SQLite

This SDK currently requires `@powersync/react-native-quick-sqlite` as a peer dependency.

Install it in your app with:

```bash
npx expo install @powersync/react-native-quick-sqlite
```

## Install Polyfills

This package connects to a PowerSync instance via HTTP streams (enabled by default) or WebSockets.
* Both connection methods require the [React Native Common Polyfills](#react-native-common-polyfills), as detailed below.
* The WebSocket method requires an [additional polyfill](#web-sockets-buffer) for the `Buffer` interface.
* Other polyfills are required for [watched queries](#babel-plugins-watched-queries) using the Async Iterator response format.

### React Native Common Polyfills

This package requires polyfills for HTTP streaming and other text encoding functions. These functions can be provided with [react-native-polyfill-globals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-polyfill-globals).

Install the collection of polyfills with:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-polyfill-globals
```

The `react-native-polyfill-globals` package uses peer dependencies for individual functions. Most modern package managers install peer dependencies by default, however currently the peer dependency version ranges are quite broad and might result in certain packages being incompatible. Currently an [issue](https://github.com/acostalima/react-native-polyfill-globals/issues/6) is open for a breaking change in one of the dependencies. The best practice is to currently add the packages as explicit dependencies with version ranges to your project with the command below.

```bash
npx expo install react-native-fetch-api@^3.0.0 react-native-url-polyfill@^2.0.0 text-encoding@^0.7.0 web-streams-polyfill@3.2.1 base-64@^1.0.0
```

Enable the polyfills in React Native app by adding the following in your top level entry point

```JavaScript
// App.js
import 'react-native-polyfill-globals/auto';
```

### HTTP Connections

HTTP connections require the HTTP streaming polyfills included in the [common section](#react-native-common-polyfills). See additional [setup](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo#android-flipper-network-plugin) required for Android.

### WebSocket Connections: Buffer

Note: Beta Release - WebSockets are currently in a beta release. It should be safe to use in production if sufficient testing is done on the client side.

Our WebSocket implementation supports binary payloads which are encoded as BSON documents.

This requires support for the `Buffer` interface.

Apply the `Buffer` polyfill

```bash
npx expo install @craftzdog/react-native-buffer
```

```javascript
import { Buffer } from '@craftzdog/react-native-buffer';

if (typeof global.Buffer == 'undefined') {
  // @ts-ignore If using TypeScript
  global.Buffer = Buffer;
}
```

This library uses `RSocket` for reactive WebSocket streams which requires `process.nextTick` to be available. Apply a polyfill if not available.

```javascript
if (typeof process.nextTick == 'undefined') {
  process.nextTick = setImmediate;
}
```

### Babel Plugins: Watched Queries

Watched queries can be used with either a callback response or Async Iterator response.

Watched queries using the Async Iterator response format require support for Async Iterators.

Expo apps currently require polyfill and Babel plugins in order to use this functionality.

```bash
npx expo install @azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill
```

Make sure to import the polyfill early in your application

```JavaScript
// App.js
import '@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill';
```

Install the async generator Babel plugin

```bash
pnpm add -D @babel/plugin-transform-async-generator-functions
```

Add the Babel plugin to your `babel.config.js` file

```JavaScript
module.exports = function (api) {
 return {
   presets: [...],
   plugins: [
     // ... Other plugins
     '@babel/plugin-transform-async-generator-functions'
   ]
 };
};
```

# Native Projects

This package uses native libraries. Create native Android and iOS projects (if not created already) by running:

```bash
npx expo run:android
# OR
npx expo run:ios
```
